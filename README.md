# Graph Neural Networks for Node and Graph Property Prediction

This project implements Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) using PyTorch Geometric to solve node-level and graph-level classification tasks on datasets from the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB). The entire project is developed in a single Google Colab notebook.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Built with **PyTorch Geometric (PyG)** and **OGB** benchmark datasets  
- Supports both **node property prediction** and **graph property prediction** tasks  
- Implements message passing networks for graph representation learning  
- Evaluates model using built-in OGB metrics and outputs predictions as CSV

## ðŸ“Ž File
- `gnn_ogb_colab.ipynb`: Complete notebook implementation, ready to run on Google Colab

## ðŸš€ Open in Google Colab
